## Plan (schedule)

### Schedule:

### Unclear Requirements: ðŸ™†
* Requirements seems Unclear for me. However, that is what I got:
Step one : Token
Step two : Parse tree
Step three: AST
Step Four: IC

### Tasks
* [x] build parsing tree
* [x] show tree
* [x] simplify tree
* [x] add lexemes
* [ ] make sure to delete nodes (free/del)
* [x] lift operands up
* [x] build AST
* [x] swap relop with 2 conditions (>=) --> !(<)
* [x] IC
* [x] backpatching
* [x] remove duplicate labels (at most 2)
* [ ] report

## Bugs:
* [ ] check_type not working properly in some cases
> added a couple of lines to fixed temporarily

* [ ] get_val_2 & get_virtual shall be combined. Yet, some functions not working then
>  * try to add flag <br>
>  * make it return list of virtual nodes to work with separately
